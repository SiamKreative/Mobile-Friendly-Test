## About
This is an experiment that started when I decided to find out how Google built their own [Mobile-Friendly Test](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/). I discovered that they're using their own API, and that luckily it's publicly availables. As the API is not documented, I have no idea for how long this experiment will work.

### Under the hood
I wanted to re-discover a few things like [Pure CSS](http://purecss.io/) and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/). I also plan to get started with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) with this project, as I only know Grunt.
